## 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication between application processes running
on different hosts. By logical communication, we mean that from an applicationâ€™s perspective, it is as if
the hosts running the processes were directly connected; in reality, the hosts may be on opposite sides
of the planet, connected via numerous routers and a wide range of link types.

### Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers

Recall that the transport layer lies just above the network layer in the protocol stack. Whereas a
transport-layer protocol provides logical communication between processes running on different hosts, a network-layer protocol provides logical-communication between
hosts.
