No, there are not addition DNS queries.

11. What is the destination port for the DNS query message? What is the source port

12. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Is this the IP address of your
default local DNS server?
13. Examine the DNS query message. What “Type” of DNS query is it? Does the
query message contain any “answers”?
14. Examine the DNS response message. How many “answers” are provided? What
do each of these answers contain?
