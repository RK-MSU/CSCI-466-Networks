# History of Computer Networking and the Internet

## The Development of Packet Switching: 1961–1972

- Ray Tomlinson wrote the first e-mail program in 1972.

## Proprietary Networks and Internetworking: 1972–1980

The initial ARPAnet was a single, closed network. In order to communicate with an ARPAnet host, one had to be actually attached to another ARPAnet IMP.

The early versions of TCP, however, were quite
different from today’s TCP. The early versions of TCP combined a reliable in-sequence delivery of data
via end-system retransmission (still part of today’s TCP) with forwarding functions (which today are
performed by IP).

Early experimentation with TCP, combined with the recognition of the importance of
an unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport service for applications such as packetized
voice, led to the separation of IP out of TCP and the development of the UDP protocol. The three key
Internet protocols that we see today—TCP, UDP, and IP—were conceptually in place by the end of the 1970s.

## A Proliferation of Networks: 1980–1990

By the end of the 1970s, approximately two hundred hosts were connected to the ARPAnet. By the end
of the 1980s the number of hosts connected to the public ­ Internet, a confederation of networks looking
much like today’s Internet, would reach a hundred thousand.

January 1, 1983 saw the official deployment of TCP/IP as the new standard host protocol for ARPAnet (replacing the NCP protocol).
